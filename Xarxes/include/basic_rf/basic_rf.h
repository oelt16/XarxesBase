  Description:  Basic RF library interface.

    The "Basic RF" library contains simple functions for packet transmission and
    reception with the CC2520 radio chip. The intention of this library is mainly
    to demonstrate how the CC2520 is operated, and not to provide a complete and
    fully-functional packet protocol. The protocol uses 802.15.4 MAC compliant data
    and acknowledgment packets, however it contains only a small subset of  the
    802.15.4 standard:
    - Association, scanning nor beacons are not implemented
    - No defined coordinator/device roles (peer-to-peer, all nodes are equal)
    - Waits for the channel to become ready, but does not check CCA twice
    (802.15.4 CSMA-CA)
    - Does not retransmit packets

    INSTRUCTIONS:
    Startup:
    1. Create a basicRfCfg_t structure, and initialize the members:
    2. Call basicRfInit() to initialize the packet protocol.

    Transmission:
    1. Create a buffer with the payload to send
    2. Call basicRfSendPacket()

    Reception:
    1. Check if a packet is ready to be received by highger layer with
    basicRfPacketIsReady()
    2. Call basicRfReceive() to receive the packet by higher layer

    FRAME FORMATS:
    Data packets (without security):
    [Preambles (4)][SFD (1)][Length (1)][Frame control field (2)]
    [Sequence number (1)][PAN ID (2)][Dest. address (2)][Source address (2)]
    [Payload (Length - 2+1+2+2+2)][Frame check sequence (2)]

    Acknowledgment packets:
    [Preambles (4)][SFD (1)][Length = 5 (1)][Frame control field (2)]
    [Sequence number (1)][Frame check sequence (2)]

//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  UINT8 basicRfSendPacket(BASIC_RF_TX_INFO *pRTI)
//
//  DESCRIPTION:
//		Transmits a packet using the IEEE 802.15.4 MAC data packet format with short addresses. CCA is
//		measured only once before backet transmission (not compliant with 802.15.4 CSMA-CA).
//		The function returns:
//			- When pRTI->ackRequest is FALSE: After the transmission has begun (SFD gone high)
//			- When pRTI->ackRequest is TRUE: After the acknowledgment has been received/declared missing.
//		The acknowledgment is received through the FIFOP interrupt.
//
//  ARGUMENTS:
//      BASIC_RF_TX_INFO *pRTI
//          The transmission structure, which contains all relevant info about the packet.
//
//  RETURN VALUE:
//		BOOL
//			Successful transmission (acknowledgment received)
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BOOL basicRfSendPacket(BASIC_RF_TX_INFO *pRTI);



//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  void halRfReceiveOn(void)
//
//  DESCRIPTION:
//      Enables the CC2420 receiver and the FIFOP interrupt. When a packet is received through this
//      interrupt, it will call halRfReceivePacket(...), which must be defined by the application
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
void basicRfReceiveOn(void);


//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  void halRfReceiveOff(void)
//
//  DESCRIPTION:
//      Disables the CC2420 receiver and the FIFOP interrupt.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
void basicRfReceiveOff(void);


//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  SIGNAL(SIG_INTERRUPT0) - CC2420 FIFOP interrupt service routine
//
//  DESCRIPTION:
//		When a packet has been completely received, this ISR will extract the data from the RX FIFO, put
//		it into the active BASIC_RF_RX_INFO structure, and call basicRfReceivePacket() (defined by the
//		application). FIFO overflow and illegally formatted packets is handled by this routine.
//
//      Note: Packets are acknowledged automatically by CC2420 through the auto-acknowledgment feature.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SIGNAL(SIG_INTERRUPT0)


//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  BASIC_RF_RX_INFO* basicRfReceivePacket(BASIC_RF_RX_INFO *pRRI)
//
//  DESCRIPTION:
//      This function is a part of the basic RF library, but must be declared by the application. Once
//		the application has turned on the receiver, using basicRfReceiveOn(), all incoming packets will
//		be received by the FIFOP interrupt service routine. When finished, the ISR will call the
//		basicRfReceivePacket() function. Please note that this function must return quickly, since the
//		next received packet will overwrite the active BASIC_RF_RX_INFO structure (pointed to by pRRI).
//
//  ARGUMENTS:
//		BASIC_RF_RX_INFO *pRRI
//	      	The reception structure, which contains all relevant info about the received packet.
//
//  RETURN VALUE:
//     BASIC_RF_RX_INFO*
//			The pointer to the next BASIC_RF_RX_INFO structure to be used by the FIFOP ISR. If there is
//			only one buffer, then return pRRI.
//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BASIC_RF_RX_INFO* basicRfReceivePacket(BASIC_RF_RX_INFO *pRRI);


//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  void basicRfInit(BASIC_RF_RX_INFO *pRRI, UINT8 channel, UINT16 panId, UINT16 myAddr)
//
//  DESCRIPTION:
//      Initializes CC2420 for radio communication via the basic RF library functions. Turns on the
//		voltage regulator, resets the CC2420, turns on the crystal oscillator, writes all necessary
//		registers and protocol addresses (for automatic address recognition). Note that the crystal
//		oscillator will remain on (forever).
//
//  ARGUMENTS:
//      BASIC_RF_RX_INFO *pRRI
//          A pointer the BASIC_RF_RX_INFO data structure to be used during the first packet reception.
//			The structure can be switched upon packet reception.
//      UINT8 channel
//          The RF channel to be used (11 = 2405 MHz to 26 = 2480 MHz)
//      UINT16 panId
//          The personal area network identification number
//      UINT16 myAddr
//          The 16-bit short address which is used by this node. Must together with the PAN ID form a
//			unique 32-bit identifier to avoid addressing conflicts. Normally, in a 802.15.4 network, the
//			short address will be given to associated nodes by the PAN coordinator.
